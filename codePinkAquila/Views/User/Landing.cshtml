    <h5 >Welcome to CodePink! <br> We're happy to have you here <br> 😃</h5>
    <h5>So what do we do?</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        We (i.e Jackie, Sierra, and Aquila) love to code and everything about it. It is a core belief of ours that every one should know how to talk to computers just like we talk to our pets. So we've created a space where fellow believers can purchase really cool gadgets and spread the love of coding. Speaking of spreading the love, you should click on the Laelynn page to learn about how we're doing that 😉
        <br> P.S. if you're thinking we're bluffing about our mission don't take our word for it. Checkout some awesome people who are were they are because of us 👇🏼 <br>
